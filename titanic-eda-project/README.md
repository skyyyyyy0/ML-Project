# Tritanic EDA Project

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

The goal is to identify key features that contributed to passenger survival using Python's data analysis and visualization libraries.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

To analyze the Titanic dataset and discover trends, patterns, and insights about passenger survival based on variables such as age, gender, class, and fare.

## ðŸ§° Tools

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
- Files:
  - `train.csv`: training data with labels
  - `test.csv`: test data without labels

## âœ… Tasks Covered

- Data loading and inspection
- Data cleaning (missing values, outliers)
- Feature analysis and visualization
- Insights and interpretation
- Summary report generation

## ðŸ“ˆ Sample Questions Explored

- Does gender affect survival?
- Were passengers in higher classes more likely to survive?
- How did age or fare influence the survival rate?

## ðŸ“Œ Output

A final notebook with plots, insights, and conclusions.  
All visualizations are saved under the `images/` folder.  
Summary of findings is available in `reports/summary.md`.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open the notebook inside `notebooks/titanic_eda.ipynb`
4. Run the cells and explore the data!
